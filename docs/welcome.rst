Fjord is the software that runs `Input (input.mozilla.org)
<http://input.mozilla.org/>`_ which allows Mozilla project to gather

2. Help with making Fjord easier for hacking on!

   for contributors.

   Any thoughts you have on making this easier are much appreciated.
   Further, if you could help us, that'd be valuable to us and all
   those who follow in your footsteps.
