 Join this project!
====================

Fjord is the software that runs `Input (input.mozilla.org)
<http://input.mozilla.org/>`_ which is one of several tools
the Mozilla community uses to gather user sentiment on Mozilla
products. This data helps us track down problems, guide new
development and generally make Mozilla products better for
users using them.

Interested in helping out? I hope so!

Generally we need help with:

1. Writing code, fixing bugs and writing tests.
2. Localizing.
3. Testing.
4. Improving the Fjord documentation.
5. Making Fjord easier for other people to contribute to.

Before contributing to Fjord, you should make sure you have done the
following things:

1. Create a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ account. If you don't want
   to, that's ok, but it does make the workflow a little harder. If you're
   new to git or development, we suggest you create a GitHub account since
   it'll reduce some of the complexities in submitting changes.

2. Join the `input-dev mailing list <https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/input-dev>`_.
   We send status reports, development environment change notices and other
   things to the mailing list. Plus it keeps an archive and it makes it
   possible for us to work together even if we're not all in the same
   time zone. Plus this is the best way to get help when you're having
   trouble.

3. Say "hi!" on the ``#input`` IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. If no one
   says anything back, it's possible no one is awake. However, if people are
   awake, someone will definitely reply and this is one of the best ways
   to get familiar with who's who and one of the places you can go to get
   help when you're having trouble.


After you've done all that, it's time to set up a development environment.
For that, see the :ref:`getting-started-chapter`.

After that, check out `our GetInolved page
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev/GetInvolved/input.mozilla.org>`_
which lists mentored bugs.

If you have problems, please let us know! See :ref:`overview`.
