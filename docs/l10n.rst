==================
 Maintaining l10n
==================


Things to know about l10n
=========================

1. translations are done in `Verbatim
   <https://localize.mozilla.org/>`_ 

2. translators are looking at our -dev environment to see the strings
   in use

3. the -dev environment should have a cronjob kicking off every 10
   minutes that updates the svn locale repository so that translators
   can see the latest stuff

:svn url:           https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/l10n-misc/trunk/input/locale
:viewvc svn:        http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc/projects/l10n-misc/trunk/input/locale/
:Input in Verbatim: https://localize.mozilla.org/projects/input/


Installing localizations from svn
=================================

Localizations are not stored in this repository, but are in Mozilla's SVN.

To get the localizations, do::

    svn checkout https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/l10n-misc/trunk/input/locale locale


.. _l10n-update-strings:

Updating strings in svn
=======================

First, ping Kadir (or whoever else) and tell him/her we're merging strings
(i.e. extracting them from our codebase and committing the changes to svn).

Then, update the svn repository::

    cd locale
    svn update
    cd ..

Then, extract the strings from the codebase::

    ./manage.py extract
    ./manage.py merge

(Optional) To see changes in the project::

    ./bin/compile-mo.sh locale/

Then, commit the new strings to svn::

    cd locale
    svn commit -m 'String update YYYY/MM/DD'

Then, tell him/her that the strings have been extracted. He/she will
update Verbatim for all locales.

.. Note::

   There are also instructions in ``./locale/README.txt``.

After that, send an email to the `dev-l10n-web mailing list
<https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-l10n-web>`_ using this template::

    Hi!

    I've just pushed new strings to Verbatim for Input.

    https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-l10n-web

    < explanation of strings changes here >

    To give you an idea of how many untranslated strings there are, I
    have computed this list:

    < copy and paste output of "./bin/stats-po.sh locale/" >

    If you have any questions, please reply to the list.

    Thank you so much for your help!

Creating new localization locales
=================================

In your projects ``settings.py`` add the new locale to
``KNOWN_LANGUAGES``.

Then run::

    $ ./manage.py merge -c

which will create directories for any locales that are missing in
``locale/``.
