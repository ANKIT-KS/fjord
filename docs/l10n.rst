Things to know about l10n
=========================

1. translations are done in `Verbatim
   <https://localize.mozilla.org/>`_

2. translators are looking at our -dev environment to see the strings
   in use

3. the -dev environment should have a cronjob kicking off every 10
   minutes that updates the svn locale repository so that translators
   can see the latest stuff

Installing localizations from svn
=================================

Localizations are not stored in this repository, but are in Mozilla's SVN.

To get the localizations, do::

    $ svn checkout https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/l10n-misc/trunk/input/locales locale


Updating strings in svn
=======================

First, ping Milos and tell him we're merging strings (i.e. extracting
them from our codebase and committing the changes to svn).

Then, update the svn repository::

    $ cd locale
    $ svn update
    $ cd ..

Then, extract the strings from the codebase::

    $ ./manage.py extract
    $ ./manage.py merge

(Optional) To see changes in the project::

    $ ./bin/compile-mo.sh locale/

Then, commit the new strings to svn::

    $ cd locale
    $ svn commit -m 'String update YYYY/MM/DD'

Then, tell Milos that the strings have been extracted. He will update
Verbatim for all locales and post a message to dev.l10n.web about the
new strings.

.. Note::

   There are also instructions in ``./locale/README.txt``.


Creating new localization locales
=================================

In your projects ``settings.py`` add the new locale to
``KNOWN_LANGUAGES``.

Then run::

    $ ./manage.py merge -c

which will create directories for any locales that are missing in
``locale/``.
