Feedback submitters
===================

We support feedback from the following things:

1. Firefox Desktop stable using the feedback form
2. Firefox for Android stable using the feedback form
3. Firefox for Android stable about:feedback

   This requires some funky code because we changed the way feedback
   posting worked between the old code base and the new one.

   We need to update Firefox for Android so it posts to the new
   codebase, then we can ditch a bunch of the funky code.

4. FirefoxOS: v1.0
